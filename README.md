# Shaded-Rendering-and-Depth-Buffering
3D Model implementation of several objects generated with triangle meshes and solid objects with vertex normals. Implementation of different polygon rendering methods (Flat, Gouraud, Phong). Implementation of the illumination equation (combined diffuse, specular, and ambient) as well as the depth buffer algorithm.
